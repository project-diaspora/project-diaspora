# Project Diaspora

Project Diaspora is a peer-to-peer payments network that allows a diaspora to send money back to their native country without tying that money to a local bank account. In a world where capital controls have become normalized, we'd like to make it possible for locals to freely use their money.

## Download Links

Project Diaspora is available as both and Android and iOS app.

# Features

Project Diaspora functions very similarly to a typical banking app but without any of the restrictions that banks impose. We support transactions in Bitcoin, Ethereum and DAI.

You can
1. Add money to your account
2. Send money to your friends and family
3. Pull up a list of your transactions 

## Build Instructions
