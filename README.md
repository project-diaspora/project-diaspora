# Project Diaspora

Project Diaspora is a peer-to-peer payments network that allows a diaspora to send money back to their native country without tying that money to a local bank account. In a world where capital controls have become normalized, we'd like to make it possible for locals to freely use their money.

## Download Links

Project Diaspora is soon to be available for both Android and iOS.

# Features

Project Diaspora functions very similarly to a typical banking app but without many of the restrictions. Supported transactions in DAI.

1. Add money to account
2. Send money to friends and family
