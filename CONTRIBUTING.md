### Commit Messages

All commit messages should follow [these best practices](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), specifically:

- Start with a subject line
- Contain a body that explains _why_ you're making the change you're making
- Reference an issue number if one exists and closing it if applicable

Aim for 2 paragraphs in the body. Not sure what to put? Include:

- What is the problem being solved?
- Why is this the best approach?
- What other approaches did you consider?
- What side effects will this approach have?
- What future work remains to be done?
